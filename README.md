# Boggle Word Game

This project implements a Boggle word game, where users can register, login, and play the Boggle game. The project contains both the client and server that are needed for the project to work as intended.

## What is Boggle?

Boggle is a game, where you locate words from the gameboard consisting of 16 dice in a 4x4 pattern within a given time limit. The words found are checked for their validity, and they provide points to the player's score. 

## Notes

This project currently only supports Boggle with finnish rules, dice set and language.
